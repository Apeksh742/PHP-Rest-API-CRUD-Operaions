# PHP-Rest-API-CRUD-Operaions
These Simple PHP files can be used to perform CRUD operations on Database system. 
NOTE: Use validations in frontend before directly taking input from user to avoid any attack on database.

There are seven files which help to perform six different major types of operations on database through REST API interface:

1. config.php: Store MYSQL server configuration files
